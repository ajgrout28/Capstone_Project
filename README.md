# Capstone_Project
All work and materials from my capstone project completed for my Bachelor's in Data Analytics for WGU

This project was completed within the guidelines outlined by the tasks for the WGU Data Analytics Capstone Project. The following aspects were required:
- Topic Approval

The Analysis was completed in JupyterLab using Python. The libraries Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and StatsModels were also utilized.

The dataset is included in this repo and was collected from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships

All knowledge for this project was gained during my coursework at WGU.
